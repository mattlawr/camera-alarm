Okay, this is the general structure of the presentation. 
We will open with a scenario: the problem. You need to wake for work, or school, but are too tired. You hit snooze once. 
Fifteen minutes isn't that bad, right?
Until you've hit snooze once for five times, and are now over an hour behind schedule.
The problem with most alarm clocks is that despite their best efforts with blasting songs and that whiny, high-pitched beeping, they
can be shut down with the simple press of a button. 
To address this issue, but mostly for... personal reasons (habitual lateness), we decided to construct our own take on the alarm clock.
Our creation requires the user to work out to put the alarm in snooze, then solve a problem to turn the alarm completely off.
*Demonstration*
Now, as our project was created at a hackathon, we have some polishing to do. We would like to transfer this entirely into an application format,
not just a website. This way it will be able to be active as a timer in the background whether the alarm is off or on. We would also like to expand 
our question repository to make it more relevant to the user and what they are studying. In the future, the user will be able to choose their
question from a multitude of subjects.
*Question Answering*
